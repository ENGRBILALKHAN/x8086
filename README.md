# x8086
## PROGRAM 1
### Write instructions that first clear bits 0 and 1 in AL. Then, if the destination operand is equal to zero, the code should jump to label L3. Otherwise, it should jump to label L4.
## PROGRAM 2
### Implement the following pseudocode in assembly language. Use short-circuit evaluation and assume that X is a 32-bit variable. If ( ebx > ecx AND ebx > edx) OR ( edx > eax ) X = 1 else X = 2
